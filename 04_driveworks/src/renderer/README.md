![Rendering Sample](sample_renderer.png)

The Renderer sample demonstrates some basic features of the rendering helpers
provided with DriveWorks. These helpers provide basic rendering of points,
lines, triangles, and textures in 2D and 3D, as well as text rendering. The
purpose of this module is not to replace a renderer but to help simple rendering
for debug visualization. The renderer uses the OpenGL ES 3.1 API.

#### Running the Sample

The command line for the sample is:

    ./sample_renderer

#### Output

The sample creates a window, displays text in various sizes, and shows an
animated 2D point list.
